# diceroller
A Dice roller in Python
This Dice roller is very simple, and uses the following steps:
1. It will prompt you to enter a number of times you wish to roll the dice, any number expressed in integers should work
2. It will prompt you to enter the number of sides you wish your theoretical dice to have, this has been tested with d2, d4, d6, d8, d10,
d12, d20, and d100. But should theoretically work with any number of sides you wish to input.
3. In the event you decide upon 6 sides, it will ask if you wish to eliminate 1s and 2s as possible results. (To aid with RPG character 
creation.) you can answer y or yes if you wish to do so.
4. It will present the numbers that it generates in an array.
